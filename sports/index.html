    <p>Football is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players each. The objective is to score goals by getting the ball into the opposing team's goal.</p>
   
    <p>Basic rules include using any part of the body except hands or arms (except for the goalkeeper) to move the ball across the field, and the team with the most goals at the end of the match wins.</p>

    <li>Offside Rule: A player is in an offside position if they are nearer to the opponent's goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent when the ball is played to them. However, it's not an offense in itself to be in an offside position; the player must also be involved in active play, as determined by the referee.</li>
    <li>Fouls and Misconduct: There are various fouls in football, such as tripping, pushing, or dangerous play. When a foul is committed, the referee can award free kicks, penalties, or even issue yellow or red cards for serious offenses.</li>
   
    <li>Throw-ins, Goal Kicks, and Corners: When the ball goes out of play on the sidelines, the team whose opponent last touched it concedes a throw-in. For goal kicks, if the attacking team kicks the ball out over the defending team's goal line, the defending team restarts play with a goal kick. When the defending team kicks the ball out over its own goal line, the attacking team is awarded a corner kick.</li>
    <li>Penalty Kicks: A penalty kick is awarded after a foul is committed inside the penalty area. It's taken from 12 yards (11 meters) away from the goal and only the goalkeeper defends the goal.</li>
    <li>Duration of the Game: A standard football match consists of two halves, each usually lasting 45 minutes, with a 15-minute halftime break. However, the referee has the authority to add extra time at the end of each half, called stoppage or injury time, to compensate for any time lost due to injuries, substitutions, or time-wasting.</li>
